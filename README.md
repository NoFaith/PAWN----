# SA:MP play song script

A simple script coded in Pawnscript that allows you to play songs on your SA:MP server. Its no big deal, but its good to study and try to learn something from it.
  I wanted to make it simple, so if you want, feel free to improve it the way you like, like adding some text box...
  
  
  And please,if you're going to use, dont forget to compile it using the Pawn Compiler, because it needs a .amx file to load.
